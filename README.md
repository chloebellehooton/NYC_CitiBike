# NYC_CitiBike
## Overview

Kate and I wanted to start an equivalent to NYC Citi Bikes in our hometown of Des Moines. To do that we need to show an angel investor that this is a viable product. First, we analyzed the NYC business model and now we can use that to start our go-to-market strategy for Des Moines. To solidify the proposal, we're including bike trip analysis for one of the key stakeholders.

## Summary

Citi Bikes has been a very successful business in Manhattan but this could be partly due to a few region-specific factors. First, New York is one of the tourist capitals of the US and even the world. This is ensuring a steady flow of new customers looking to have an authentic New York experience. New York also has horrific traffic and minimal parking. Therefore the alternatives are to walk or take the subway. Citi Bikes have created a great alternative to walking. 

They are particularly popular with men going to and from work. Clothing might be a factor as biking is not as feasible in many women's work clothing options as mens. 

The question is, will this business model be feasible in Des Moines? I would recommend further analysis into the walking and public transit patterns of the city and compare it to NYC. Given the attributes of the midwest and sprawling nature of the area, it might make less sense as an alternative. Is there a walking culture in Des Moines? 
### Additional Visualizations
1. I would suggest doing a visualization showing the average mileage of commutes to work for Des Moines versus NYC. 
2. I would also suggest comparing the number of people who use short distance public transit (such as a subway, not an Amtrak) in Des Moines versus NYC. 
3. Comparison of the number of tourists coming to Des Moines versus NYC
